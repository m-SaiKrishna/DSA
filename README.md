# ðŸ§  DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice** repository! ðŸ‘‹  
This repo contains a collection of problems I have solved as part of my DSA preparation for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Track my DSA learning journey.
- Practice problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, HackerRank, GFG, etc.
- Improve problem-solving and coding skills.
- Make it easy for others (including recruiters and peers) to see my progress and approach.
